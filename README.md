🧠##Hand Sign detection using python and mathematics✋
Here we have a dataset of numbers and different digits represented by hand sign#️⃣
And using mathematics and python, I've made a model that detects the number represented in the image.
This project can be much broader, for instance you can create a pipline that gets the image from a camera
and using that as an input for the model and turn the output of the model into digital signs, etc.
